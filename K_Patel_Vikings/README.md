Welcome to my repository for WEB601 assignments! K_Patel_WEB601Assignments_vikings is the repository. Vikings are the theme. The goal of this project is to create a single-page application with the "Vikings" theme at its core. I'll be presenting stuff about various Vikings in this app.

Application Angular: K_Patel_Vikings For this assignment, I have developed a brand-new Angular application called K_Patel_Vikings. The package.json file has the application's version set to 0.0.1.

Commands for Terminals The following commands can be used at the terminal to create directives, pipelines, and Angular components:

To create a component, use npm run-script generatecomponent. To create a pipe, use npm run-script generatepipe. To create a directive, use npm run-script generatedirective. Supporting Documents There is a folder named helper-files inside the app folder:

content-interface.ts: Specifies parameters for an interface named Content. content-list.ts: This file has a class called ContentList with private attributes. To create a component, use the npm run-script generatecomponent command. To create a pipe, use npm run-script generatepipe. To create a directive, use npm run-script generatedirective. Supporting Documents You can locate a folder named helper-files:methods to manage material inside the app folder. Content-Card Elements I instantiated the ContentList class and added at least three legitimate sports-related items to it in the constructor of a component I named Content-card.

Displaying Content The functions defined in the ContentList class are used to show the contents of the ContentList in the HTML of the Content-card component.

Bonus feature: I added a function to the ContentList class that, upon receiving an index that is outside the range of the array, returns an HTML error message.
